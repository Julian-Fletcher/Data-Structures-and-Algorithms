# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains my implementations for several data structures and some algorithms as well. I made this project to learn C++ and to prepare for my upcoming research with Djikstra's Algorithm. 

## Data Structures Implemented
* Linked Lists
* Binary Search Tree
* Heaps
* Queues
* Graphs

## Algorithms Implemented
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth-First Search
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
